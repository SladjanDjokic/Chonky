# Introduction

**Chonky is a file browser component for React.** It tries to recreate the native file
browsing experience in your browser. Chonky supports drag & drop, file selection,
image thumbnails, and much more!

# Philosophy

Please read this section to understand what Chonky is and is not.

<br />

### 1. Chonky is the presentation layer.

Chonky takes a list of files and shows them to the user. It does not and should not
know where the files come from, nor should it know how file operations are carried out.

That said, when it comes to file browser UI, **Chonky tries to cover as many _UI_
features as possible.**

<br />

### 2. Chonky is just the tip of the FS iceberg. You will need to implement many things yourself.

Chonky saves you **a lot** of time by providing a pretty file browser UI for your
users. However, apart from a pretty UI, working with the file system requires a lot of
custom business logic. **You will have to implement this business logic yourself.**

In the future, Chonky might provide extensions like S3 or FTP adapters, but this is
not the case today.

<br />

### 3. Developing file browsers is hard. Each use case is unique.

It is not possible for Chonky to address _all_ use cases explicitly. To solve this
problem, Chonky was written to be very flexible, and _all_ internal interfaces and
contexts are exported in some way. **Feel free to dive into the source code of Chonky
and customise logic as necessary**.

However, before you start making adjustments to Chonky's source code, please
[create an issue](https://github.com/TimboKZ/Chonky/issues) on GitHub describing your
use case. There's a good chance your use case is supported, just not documented.
