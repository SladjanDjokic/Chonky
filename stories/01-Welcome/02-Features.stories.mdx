## Notes about 1.x

-   Chonky `1.x` is a complete rewrite of `0.x`, now using hooks under the hood!
-   Chonky `1.x` package is 5 times smaller than `0.x` version when minified & gzipped!
-   Internal state management is done using [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/).
-   Keyboard shortcuts are implemented using [HotKeys.js](https://wangchujiang.com/hotkeys/).
-   File sorting functionality uses [fast-sort](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fast-sort).
-   Text search is implemented using [fuzzy-search](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fuzzy-search).
-   Drag & drop uses [react-dnd](https://github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd).
-   TypeScript declarations are dynamically embedded into documentation using
    [markdown-dynamic-codeblock-loader](https://github.com/TimboKZ/markdown-dynamic-codeblock-loader).
