# Installation

Add Chonky to your NPM project:

```bash
npm install chonky
```

Then, import relevant components and styles:

```js
import 'chonky/style/main.css';
import { FileBrowser, FileList } from 'chonky';
```

And you're good to go! Check other sections in the documentation to see how Chonky
components can be used.

### Usage with Typescript

Chonky was built using Typescript. For your static typing needs, many of the internal
types and interfaces are exported. Some types are generic, to make it easier for you
to integrate Chonky into you Typescript package.

If you're also using Typescript, you can add Chonky types to your project using
standard imports:

```ts
// FileArray is a TS type
import { FileArray } from 'chonky';

const myFiles: FileArray = [
    {
        id: 'abD3',
        name: 'README.txt',
    },
    null,
];
```
