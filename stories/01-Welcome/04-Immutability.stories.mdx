# Immutability in Chonky

Chonky assumes that the objects and arrays you provide through `FileBrowser` props (or
any other props) are **immutable**. It is very important for your application to
guarantee immutability, otherwise Chonky components will not update correctly.

## What is immutability?

Immutability is a crucial concept in React performance optimizations, and is used in
many React libraries, such as Redux. If you're a seasoned React developer, you
already know what immutability is. If you're new to React, you should learn this
concept as soon as possible.

I will not go into the details of data immutability here. Instead, I'll point you to
some useful resources which you can study yourself:

-   [Dave Ceddia - Immutability in React and Redux: The Complete Guide](https://daveceddia.com/react-redux-immutability-guide/)
-   [Redux FAX - Immutable Data](https://redux.js.org/faq/immutable-data)
-   [StackOverflow - Why should objects in Redux be immutable?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34958775/why-should-objects-in-redux-be-immutable/34962065#34962065)

## Example of a mutable data mistake

A common mistake for new Chonky users is mutating the `files` array directly. For
example, we pass Chonky some initial file array:

```tsx
const [files, setFiles] = React.useState([]);

<FileBrowser files={files}>
    <FileList />
</FileBrowser>;
```

And later, we try to add a new file by _mutating_ (changing without creating a new
copy) the array:

```tsx
setFiles((files) => {
    // vvv This is bad, don't do this!
    files.push({ id: 'vdSw', name: 'passwords.txt' });
    // Newer React versions will actually throw an error if you try to extend the array.
    return files;
});
```

If this update goes through without React throwing an error, you will notice that
your new file will not appear in the file browser. This is because the array
reference did not change (we reused the same array), and Chonky thinks it doesn't
need to re-render.

The correct way to add a new file is to create a new copy of the array and populate
it using the ES6 spread operator:

```tsx
setFiles((oldFiles) => {
    const newFiles = [...oldFiles, { id: 'VsE', name: 'robots.txt' }];
    return newFiles;
});
```

With the code above, the array reference will change after the update, and Chonky
will show your new file in the file browser. The same rules apply to `folderChain`,
`fileActions` and any other object or array you pass to Chonky.
