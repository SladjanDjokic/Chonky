# Built-in file actions

## Notes about built-in file actions

### `OpenFiles`

`data.files` will always be set, but `data.target` can sometimes be undefined. For
example, when the user clicks `Actions -> Open selection`, target will be undefined.

## File actions that are enabled by default:

```ts { "file": "<src>/util/file-actions-definitions.ts", "symbol": "DefaultFileActions" }
'If you see this text, there was an error loading the code snippet';
```

## All pre-defined file actions:
